        <h1>Showing that Electric Vehicles with No Engine Cylinders have the Highest MPG(e)</h1>
  </header>
  <pre>Until early 2000s, almost all vehicles ran on gasoline and diesel</pre>
  <pre>With the invention of hybrid and electric vehicles, it has become necessary to compare the energy efficiency of electric, gasoline, and diesel vehicles</pre>
  <pre>In this visualization, we will compare the energy efficiency of electric, diesel, and gas vehicles</pre>
  <pre>The energy efficiency for gas and diesel vehicles is measured in Miles Per Gallon(MPG).</pre>
  <pre>The energy efficiency for electric vehicles is measured in Miles Per Gallon Equaivalent(MPGe) since it uses battery rather than fuel.</pre>
  <pre>MPGe is the distance an electric vehicle can travel on 33kWh of electricity which if equivalent to 1 gallon of gas fuel</pre>
  <pre>Engine cylinders are chambers where fuel is combusted and power is generated for gasoline and diesel vehicles. Electric vehicles have no engine cylinders since they use a battery</pre>
  <pre>For the purposes of this presentation we will be using the unit MPG(e) to for energy efficiency of electric and tradition fuel</pre>
